# Volumetric Path Tracer

![banner](https://github.com/sergeneren/Volumetric-Path-Tracer/blob/master/img/banner.png)

VPT is a path tracer to render openvdb files on gpu using Cuda. It uses the [Ray Tracing Gems Vol 28.](https://github.com/Apress/ray-tracing-gems/tree/master/Ch_28_Ray_Tracing_Inhomogeneous_Volumes) as the base, and implements volume rendering algorithms from [PBRT](https://www.pbrt.org/). This repo is currently built and tested only under Windows.

## Release Notes

v1.1 Alpha

## Installation

Either download the source as a zip file or right click to a desired location and use below command with git bash
```
git clone https://github.com/sergeneren/Volumetric-Path-Tracer
```


### Dependencies

VPT depends on following libraries. All the libraries are choosen so they can be easily installed by vcpkg using ```vcpkg.exe install 'package name'``` command. 

* [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/)
* [GLFW3](https://www.glfw.org/) 
* [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [STB Image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [tinyexr](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr)
* [nlohmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

### Build 
VPT expects [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg), Visual Studio 2017 and CMake to be installed.  

**Step 1:** With CMake Gui select the "VPT" folder as source directory and create a build directory of your choice.

**Step 2:** Choose x64 for optional platform and specify toolchain for cross-compiling

**Step 3:** Specify the location your vcpkg cmake file

**Step 4:** Configure with these options. If you would like to render procedural sky sampling textures to a folder before rendering, mark the "RENDER_ENV_TEXTURES" option

**Step 5:** Generate and open the VS file. Build VPT in "Release" configuration. This will create a "VPT" folder under build directory and vpt.exe. Necessary binaries will be placed here. 
 
### Usage 

VPT has two command line arguments: A vdb file name as first argument, and a second optional environment texture. If you wish to use an environment map with VPT just specify the hdri in command line, for example: 

```.\vpt.exe dragon.vdb Barce_Rooftop_C_3k.hdr```

Currently VPT expects vdb and hdri files to be under assets directory. This directory is assigned at cmake during configuration. 

You can find couple hdri maps under assets directory which are provided by [sIbl Archive](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html) and [HDRI Skies](https://hdri-skies.com/).

The interactive camera in application uses left mouse for orbiting, middle mouse for panning, and mouse wheel for zooming. keyboard "s" takes a screenshot and places it under "bin/render" folder with .tga or .exr extension. Keyboard "-" and "+" changes FOV and "ESC" key quits the application. "F" key frames the current vdb file so it is in the cameras fov.
